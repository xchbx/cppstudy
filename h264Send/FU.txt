.8.  Fragmentation Units (FUs)
This payload type allows fragmenting a NAL unit into several RTP
packets.  Doing so on the application layer instead of relying on
lower layer fragmentation (e.g., by IP) has the following advantages:
o  The payload format is capable of transporting NAL units bigger
than 64 kbytes over an IPv4 network that may be present in pre
recorded video, particularly in High Definition formats (there is

     a limit of the number of slices per picture, which results in a

     limit of NAL units per picture, which may result in big NAL

     units).
     o  The fragmentation mechanism allows fragmenting a single picture
     and applying generic forward error correction as described in
     section 12.5.

     RFC 3984           RTP Payload Format for H.264 Video      February 2005
     Fragmentation is defined only for a single NAL unit and not for any
     aggregation packets.  A fragment of a NAL unit consists of an integer
     number of consecutive octets of that NAL unit.  Each octet of the NAL
     unit MUST be part of exactly one fragment of that NAL unit.
     Fragments of the same NAL unit MUST be sent in consecutive order with
     ascending RTP sequence numbers (with no other RTP packets within the
     same RTP packet stream being sent between the first and last
     fragment).  Similarly, a NAL unit MUST be reassembled in RTP sequence
     number order.
     When a NAL unit is fragmented and conveyed within fragmentation units
     (FUs), it is referred to as a fragmented NAL unit.  STAPs and MTAPs
     MUST NOT be fragmented.  FUs MUST NOT be nested; i.e., an FU MUST NOT
     contain another FU.
     The RTP timestamp of an RTP packet carrying an FU is set to the NALU
     time of the fragmented NAL unit.
     Figure 14 presents the RTP payload format for FU-As.  An FU-A
     consists of a fragmentation unit indicator of one octet, a
     fragmentation unit header of one octet, and a fragmentation unit
     payload.

     Figure 14.  RTP payload format for FU-A

The FU indicator octet has the following format:
+---------------+
|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|F|NRI|  Type   |
+---------------+

Values equal to 28 and 29 in the Type field of the FU indicator octet
identify an FU-A and an FU-B, respectively.  The use of the F bit is
described in section 5.3.  The value of the NRI field MUST be set
according to the value of the NRI field in the fragmented NAL unit.

The FU header has the following format:
+---------------+
|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|S|E|R|  Type   |
+---------------+

S: 1 bit
When set to one, the Start bit indicates the start of a fragmented
NAL unit.  When the following FU payload is not the start of a
fragmented NAL unit payload, the Start bit is set to zero.

R: 1 bit
The Reserved bit MUST be equal to 0 and MUST be ignored by the
receiver.
