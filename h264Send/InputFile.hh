    // "BasicTaskScheduler" event loop, using "select()"), we implement file reading
    // in Windows using synchronous, rather than asynchronous, I/O.  This can severely
    // limit the scalability of servers using this code that run on Windows.
    // If this is a problem for you, then either use a better operating system,
    // or else write your own Windows-specific event loop ("TaskScheduler" subclass)
    // that can handle readable data in Windows open files as an event.
